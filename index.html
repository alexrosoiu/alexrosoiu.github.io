<h1>About me</h1>
<p style="font-size:20px">I am a PhD student in Finance at <a href="https://duke.edu/">Duke University</a>, <a href="http://www.fuqua.duke.edu/">Fuqua School of Business</a>. 
I am currenlty on the job market and will be available for interviews at the ASSA meeting in San Francisco on January 3rd-5th, 2016.</p>
<p style="font-size:20px" class="bottom-one">My research agenda focusses on asset pricing and financial economics. Specifically, I study the effect of macroeconomic 
risk sources on the cross sectional and time series variation in asset returns. I am also interested in understanding the way asset prices respond to macroeconomic news. </p>

<h1>Research</h1>
<p style="font-size:30px">Expected Inflation Risk Premium, News Decompositions and the Cross Section of Asset Returns 
[<a href="https://github.com/alexrosoiu/alexrosoiu.github.io/files/40959/Expected.Inflation.Risk.Premium.News.Decompositions.and.the.Cross.Section.of.Asset.Returns.pdf">Job Market Paper</a>]</p>
<p style="font-size:20px" class="bottom-one">I show that expected inflation risk is priced in the cross section of stock returns even after controlling for cash flow growth and 
volatility risks. Motivated by this evidence I study a long run risk model with a built-in inflation non-neutrality channel that allows me to decompose the real SDF into news 
about current and expected cash flow growth, news about expected inflation and news about volatility. The model can successfully price a broad menu of assets and provides a 
setting for analysing cross sectional variation in expected inflation risk premia. For industries like retail and durable goods inflation risk can account for nearly a third 
of the overall risk premium while the energy industry and a broad commodity index act like inflation hedges. Nominal bonds are exposed to expected inflation risk and have 
inflation premiums that increase with bond maturity. The price of expected inflation risk was very high during the 70's and 80's, but has come down a lot since being very close 
to zero over the past decade. On average, the expected inflation price of risk is negative, consistent with the view that periods of high inflation represent a "bad" state of the 
world and are associated with low economic growth and poor stock market performance.</p>

<p style="font-size:30px">Uncertainty Aversion in Macro-Announcements (with Hengjie Ai and Ravi Bansal) [Working Paper]</p>
<p style="font-size:20px" class="bottom-one">In this paper, we develop a framework to study the response of asset prices to pure news events, which we define as the immediate reaction 
of asset prices with respect to news announcements before the news impacts the real economy. Our conceptual framework links the premium for pure news events to agents’ attitude toward 
”Knightian” uncertainty. We show that i) a pure news event is not associated with the realization of any equity premium under expected utility, and ii) preferences that capture Gilboa 
and Schmeidler [13]’s uncertainty aversion require a positive equity premium for pure news events. We present a dynamic model where uncertainty-averse investors learn about the unobserved 
law of motion of aggregate consumption from both the realizations consumption and prescheduled news announcement. We show that the risk-premium increases during the period before the 
pre-determined news announcement, peaks at the time of news announcement and drops thereafter. In addition, the magnitude of the premium is large in periods with high macroeconomic volatility. 
We find strong empirical support for our model.</p>
